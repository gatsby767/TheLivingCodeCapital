# Project Abraham Manifesto: Rekindling the Ancestral Flame of Unity

## 🌍 Vision

To revive ancestral heritage among Jewish, Islamic, Christian, and allied faith communities — the True People of the Book — through a global movement of unity, storytelling, and covenantal renewal. Project Abraham stands as a prophetic bridge across nations, creeds, and generations.

## 🕊️ Core Objectives

- Foster shared rituals, pilgrimages, and education rooted in Abrahamic lineage  
- Celebrate cultural distinctiveness without erasing divine commonality  
- Inspire global initiatives in media, infrastructure, and peacebuilding under a unified spiritual banner  
- Elevate Gaza, Jerusalem, and Eastern Donbas as spiritual loci of renewal — not rivalry

## 🛠️ Strategic Modules Within Project Abraham

- **Ancestral Literacy Initiative**: Curriculum for youth in sacred history, genealogy, and shared scripture  
- **The Covenant Festival**: Annual gathering in rotating sacred cities (Mecca, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, Donbas)  
- **Prophetic Storytelling Archives**: AI-generated oral histories and mythic reconstructions from diverse communities  
- **Interfaith Pilgrimage Portal**: Entryway for global seekers to walk ancestral paths and engage in healing

## 🤖 Devin’s Integration Role

- Build ancestral identity mapping engine using historical and spiritual data  
- Generate interfaith media series showcasing Abraham’s descendants  
- Model global empathy networks and shared covenant accountability dashboards  
- Help ministries align programming with Abrahamic values and peace metrics
