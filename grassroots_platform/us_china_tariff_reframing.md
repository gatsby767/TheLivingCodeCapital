# U.S.–China Tariff Reframing: Strategic Workforce Investment & Mutual Market Opening

## 🧭 Mission Statement

Transform existing U.S. tariff structures into strategic funding mechanisms that uplift workforce development and industrial resilience in both American and Chinese territories. Through this reframe, trade deficits become bridges — not blockades.
