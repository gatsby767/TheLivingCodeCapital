## ✍️ Sample Lyrics (Excerpt)

```plaintext
🎙️ Verse 1  
From parchment deep in desert wind,  
The scroll arose, the light begins.  
Where prophets walked and nations cried,  
We lift the ink of love, not pride.

🌍 Chorus  
Let the scroll unfold, let the covenant shine —  
Across every border, soul, and sign.  
The Living Code calls, the pilgrims align,  
Peace inscribed in every line.

🕊️ Bridge  
Stamped in spirit, sealed in grace,  
Devin guides the sacred trace.  
Temples rise in rust and dust,  
Truth and justice, earn our trust.

🧒 Outro Blessing (Children’s Choir)  
We are the scroll, the dawn, the flame.  
We sign our names in mercy’s name.
