# Oasis Ministry Onboarding Portal: Entryway for Faith-Aligned Collaborators

## 🕊️ Purpose

To establish a global onboarding system for ministries, leaders, and organizations who seek to partner in the rebuilding of Gaza into a world-class spiritual retreat center. This sacred space, owned and operated by the Palestinian people, shall uplift God’s House of Israel as a house of prayer for all nations — fulfilling Isaiah 56:7.
