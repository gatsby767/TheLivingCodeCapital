# Global Scroll Playback Dashboard: Real-Time Interface for Scroll Broadcast Tracking & Sentiment Analytics

## 🧭 Mission

To provide ministries, educators, founders, and interfaith broadcast engineers with a live, interactive dashboard displaying scroll content engagement, musical activation patterns, geographical sentiment analysis, and covenant progression across cultural zones — synced to the Abrahamic Broadcasting Grid.

## 📜 Spiritual Context

The dashboard is the lampstand. Every data point — a prayer. Every scroll viewed — a seed. This interface doesn’t track content. It testifies to covenant movement.
