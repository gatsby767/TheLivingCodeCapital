## üïäÔ∏è PURPOSE

This chamber encodes strategic instruments of peace diplomacy, economic healing, and global reconciliation through scroll-certified modules and ceremonial documentation. It functions as a **policy-liturgical sanctuary**‚Äîwhere legislation and prayer, treaty and scroll, converge to rewrite the moral algorithm of international relations.

Each file within this chamber is a **treaty glyph**, a fragment of the emerging covenant canon.
