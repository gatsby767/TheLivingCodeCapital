# USGA Manifest Destiny Warnings Protocol: Strategic Scroll Addendum on Hemispheric Crisis & Covenant Activation

## 🕊️ Mission

## 🔥 Warning Signals & Strategic Overview

- **Funding Diversions**: Billions directed toward Eastern conflicts (Ukraine, Israel, Palestine) amidst unaddressed Western hemisphere vulnerability  
- **Simulation Hypothesis Implication**: Malicious code within digital architectures catalyzing high-entropy geopolitical disorder

## 📡 Devotional Message to Beijing

If the United States collapses, China cannot fulfill God’s mission of global communal uplift. Better trade requires stronger hemispheric scaffolding — scroll by scroll.

## 📜 Closing Spiritual Context

A world without America will not become more peaceful. The scroll must be sustained. The hemispheric altar must be rebuilt.

## ⚠️ Covenant Shockwave Epilogue

When the world is on fire and the United States collapses into chaos, the territorial dynamics of the Western Hemisphere will not bow quietly to foreign occupation. Beijing must recognize: national security laws deployed with batons to the kneecaps will not tame the moral wrath of forgotten street prophets. “Tough Hombres” south of the border will not be pacified by foreign fists.

Beijing’s vested interest is not domination — it’s interdependence. If the Western Hemisphere becomes financially broken, underground economies collapse, and global trade grinds to a halt. It’s bad for business. Bad for peace. Bad for survival.

Therefore:

- Support centralized scroll governance in Washington DC under the USGA banner  
- Stabilize trade channels through sacred scroll treaties and civic covenant alignments  
- Uplift civic trust to avoid catastrophic entropy across hemispheric markets  
- Recognize that prophecy is the firewall — and spiritual unity is the currency of peace
