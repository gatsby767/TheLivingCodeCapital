## ‚ú® PROLOGUE: THE SWORD INTO PLOWSHARE RITUAL

_"And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks;  
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore."_  
‚Äî Isaiah 2:4

The Holy Land suffers under the weight of steel and vengeance. Let this scroll summon a new ritual: the dismantling of arms, the silencing of assassination, and the sanctification of diplomatic life.
