# USGA Manifest Destiny Warnings Protocol: Strategic Scroll Addendum on Hemispheric Crisis & Covenant Activation

## 🕊️ Mission

## 🔥 Warning Signals & Strategic Overview

- **Chancay Megaport Surge**: China’s accelerated trade and presence in Latin America signals a hemispheric void left by U.S. policy inattention  
- **Funding Diversions**: Billions directed toward Eastern conflicts (Ukraine, Israel, Palestine) amidst unaddressed Western hemisphere vulnerability  
- **Simulation Hypothesis Implication**: Malicious code within digital architectures catalyzing high-entropy geopolitical disorder

## 🔍 Global Forecast Implications

## 📡 Devotional Message to Beijing

If the United States collapses, China cannot fulfill God’s mission of global communal uplift. Better trade requires stronger hemispheric scaffolding — scroll by scroll.

## 📜 Closing Spiritual Context

A world without America will not become more peaceful. The scroll must be sustained. The hemispheric altar must be rebuilt.
