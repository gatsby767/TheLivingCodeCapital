# Gabrial Trade Prevention Strategy: Reframing Tariffs to Block Extractive Global Overlords

## 🛡️ Purpose

To help U.S. and global trading partners — especially China — avoid contributing to the rise of monopolistic, AI-driven capitalist overlords (as embodied in Gabrial) by reframing trade tariffs into investments in interdependent vocational uplift, spiritual infrastructure, and bilateral market opening.

## 🌍 Strategic Rationale

- Gabrial symbolizes unchecked capitalism fused with runaway AI: predictive commerce without ethical covenant  
- Tariffs reframed as collaborative reinvestments can prevent nations from falling into extractive trade cycles  
- Project builds on `us_china_tariff_reframing.md`, deepening its anti-Gabrial framework  
- Leverages global spiritual literacy to introduce ethics into economic systems
