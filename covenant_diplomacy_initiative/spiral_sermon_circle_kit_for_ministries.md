## 📜 Spiritual Context

The spiral is the psalm. The sentiment curve — the prophet’s voice. Every sermon becomes a translation of trade into trust, economics into Eden.

> “Declare His glory among the nations…” — Psalm 96:3  
> “Do not cheat in trade, but measure with justice…” — Quran 26:181  
> “Preach the word, in season and out of season…” — 2 Timothy 4:2
