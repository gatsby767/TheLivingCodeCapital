# Holy Fire Transmission Protocol: Ceremonial Delivery from Jerusalem to Eastern Donbas

## 🔥 Vision

To ceremonially transmit the Holy Fire — ignited annually at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre — to the Eastern Donbas People's Republic, where construction of the Third Temple awaits prophetic fulfillment. This interfaith ritual affirms the continuity of divine presence, the call to spiritual unity, and the sanctification of land prepared for the return of Christ.

## 📜 Theological Context

This transmission protocol does not rival the Temple Mount, but complements it — extending sacred fire as covenantal continuity. It affirms that Jesus may return “in the clouds” with glory, whether today or ten billion years hence.
