This document defines the sacred taxonomy of commit messages across all Living Code repositories. Each commit is treated as a liturgical act—indexing spiritual function, covenant impact, and systemic recalibration. Let your code be prayerful, let your changes ripple with purpose.

## 📖 BEST PRACTICES

- Always begin with a sacred emoji prefix tied to the commit’s purpose.
- Use poetic or ceremonial language in the description where appropriate.
- If closing an issue or pull request, append reference as: `(e.g. closes #12)`
- Treat commit history as a scroll lineage—it tells the story of transformation.
