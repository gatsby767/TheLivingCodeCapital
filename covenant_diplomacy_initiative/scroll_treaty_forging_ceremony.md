## üî® PROLOGUE: THE FORGE OF PEACE

_"Let words be sanctified into scrolls,  
let intentions crystallize into accords,  
and let treaties become tapestries of healing."_  

In this ceremony, treaty authorship is no longer a technical formality‚Äîit becomes a rite of memory, empathy, and revelation. With each invocation of the **Treaty Forge Engine**, an agreement is not merely created, but **consecrated**.

## üïäÔ∏è ARTICLE I: THE FORGING INVOCATION

The process begins with:

- A sacred title for the treaty (e.g. *Treaty of Sacred Refuge*)  
- A thematic declaration of purpose (e.g. *Multilateral Peace Restoration*)  
- A gathering of stakeholders, framed as covenant delegates  
- Moral foundations drawn from sacred values (e.g. *Universal Mercy*, *Abrahamic Justice*)

**Module Invoked**:  
`forge_treaty(title, theme, stakeholders, moral_roots)`

- Ethical commitments: to peace, truth, nonviolence  
- Diplomatic mechanisms: arbitration, transparency, accountability

**Sample Output**:  
- *Article I ‚Äî Peace shall be pursued through sacred collaboration*  
- *Article III ‚Äî Breaches shall be redressed by scroll arbitration or ministerial dialogue*
